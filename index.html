                                <p>The website was developed using React.js for the front-end and Express.js for the back-end. The main goal of this website was to offer a wide range of services to users, based on their designated roles, which included admin, user, and manufacturer. Admins were granted permission to add manufacturers and modify user roles as necessary. Manufacturers, on the other hand, had the ability to add or update products, while users were authorized to browse or purchase products.</p>

                                <p>One of the unique features of the website was the inclusion of distinct 3D models for each product that users could view on the website. To achieve this functionality, the developers utilized react-three-fiber to seamlessly load the 3D models onto the website.</p>

                                <p> In addition, a testing script was created in Python using the Selenium framework. The purpose of this script was to validate that the user data was being stored correctly in the database. This testing script was designed to ensure the proper functioning of the website, and to provide a seamless user experience.</p>

                                <p>A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was constructed using Yolov5 to detect the car brand depicted in images. 
                                    The CNN consisted of 157 hidden layers and a total of 7,020,913 parameters. 
                                    The model was trained using the Google Colab platform, utilizing 1200 images for training and an additional 1200 images for validation.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Upon completion of the training process, the model achieved a high level of accuracy, with an accuracy rate of 87% after running for 584 epochs. 
                                    To further optimize the model's performance, annotations were added to the images using RoboFlow.

                                <p>An application was developed with the capability for users to add items to a shopping cart and subsequently place orders. Upon submission of an order, the purchase history would be recorded in an SQL server. 
                                    The development of this application was carried out using Android Studio, a powerful tool that provides a robust analysis framework and includes over 365 different lint checks.</p>
                                
                                <br>

                                <p>To implement the desired functionality of the application, Java was utilized as the back-end programming language to handle SQL CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) requests. 
                                    The XML language was also employed in designing the user interface (UI) of the application. </p>

                                <br> 

                                <p> The resulting application provides users with a user-friendly and intuitive platform for managing their shopping activities, and facilitates the recording of their purchase history for future reference. 
                                    The use of Android Studio and Java, in conjunction with the SQL server, allowed for the implementation of a highly effective and efficient shopping application.</p>

                                <p>A website was developed to enable users to access step-by-step instructions and ingredient lists for each recipe. 
                                    The front-end of the website was designed using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, while Express was used as the back-end system to handle GET and POST requests. 
                                    The EJS template engine was also utilized to enable dynamic changes to the page's information.</p>

                                <p> To streamline the user login process, middlewares like Passport were implemented. 
                                    This middleware allowed users to log in quickly, within one to two seconds, by storing user information to the MongoDB database.</p>
